# Dog VS Cat

I did this demo project to apply my understanding of convolutional neural networks, and it is a demo because it is not trained on a large scale of data only 900 images which is nothing really so its not the best but it does the job more or less.

In this project the CNN reads the image pixels and starts analyzing through the layers it has and gets to a decision in the end.


## Usage
simply load an image to the predictions folder and the in the last code segment change the image name to the image you added
